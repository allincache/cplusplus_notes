In C++, `std::atomic` is a crucial part of concurrent programming for atomic operations. Here is a simple example of C++ concurrent code that demonstrates how to use `std::atomic` to ensure thread-safe access to a shared integer.

First, ensure that your compiler supports C++11 or higher, as `std::atomic` was introduced in C++11.


```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <atomic>
#include <vector>

std::atomic<int> counter(0); // Atomic counter initialized to 0

void increment(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        ++counter; // Atomic increment operation
    }
}

int main() {
    const int num_threads = 10; // Number of threads
    const int increment_amount = 1000; // Number of increments per thread

    std::vector<std::thread> threads;

    // Create threads, each incrementing the counter
    for (int i = 0; i < num_threads; ++i) {
        threads.emplace_back(increment, increment_amount);
    }

    // Wait for all threads to finish
    for (auto& t : threads) {
        t.join();
    }

    // Output the final counter value
    std::cout << "Final counter value: " << counter << std::endl;

    // The expected final value should be num_threads * increment_amount
    std::cout << "Expected final value: " << num_threads * increment_amount << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we create an atomic counter `counter` of type `std::atomic<int>` and initialize it to 0. Then, we define a function `increment` that takes an integer parameter `n` and atomically increments `counter` `n` times.

In the `main` function, we create multiple threads, and each thread calls the `increment` function to increment the counter. Finally, we wait for all threads to complete and output the final counter value. Since we use `std::atomic`, even if multiple threads increment the counter simultaneously, there will be no data race or inconsistent results.

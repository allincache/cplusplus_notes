Common C++ thread synchronization methods:

1. **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)**:
- Mutex is one of the most commonly used thread synchronization mechanisms.
- It is used to protect shared resources, preventing multiple threads from accessing and modifying the same resource simultaneously, thus avoiding data inconsistency.
- When a thread needs to access a shared resource, it must first lock the mutex and unlock it after accessing.

2. **Condition Variable**:
- Condition variables allow threads to wait under a specific condition until that condition is met and the thread is awakened.
- It is often used together with mutexes to achieve more complex synchronization logic.
- One or more threads can wait on a condition variable until another thread sends a notification indicating that the condition has been met.

3. **Semaphore**:
- A semaphore is a counter used to control the number of threads accessing shared resources simultaneously.
- It can be used to limit the number of concurrent accesses to a particular resource.
- When the number of requested threads exceeds the semaphore value, some threads will be blocked until the semaphore value increases.

4. **Spinlock**:
- Spinlock is a busy-waiting lock.
- When the lock is occupied, the thread will continuously check if the lock is released instead of being suspended.
- This is suitable for scenarios where the lock holding time is short, and the thread does not wish to relinquish the CPU during the waiting period.

5. **Read-Write Lock**:
- Read-write locks allow multiple threads to read shared resources simultaneously but only allow one thread to write.
- This is very useful in scenarios where read operations are far more frequent than write operations, improving concurrent performance.

6. **Atomic Operations**:
- Atomic operations are uninterruptible, meaning they cannot be interrupted by other threads during execution.
- C++11 introduced `std::atomic`, which provides atomic operations to ensure safe data access in a multithreaded environment.

7. **Barrier**:
- Barrier allows a group of threads to synchronize at a certain point.
- All threads must reach the barrier before they can continue executing. This is often used to ensure that all threads have completed a certain stage of work before moving together to the next stage.

8. **Software Transactional Memory (STM)**:
- STM allows multiple threads to perform a series of operations atomically.
- If a transaction is interrupted by another transaction during execution, it will roll back and retry.
- Although the C++ standard library does not directly support STM, it can be implemented through third-party libraries.

Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, suitable for different scenarios and needs. When choosing a thread synchronization method, one should weigh and select based on specific circumstances.

The traits technique in C++ is a template metaprogramming technique used to obtain type information or perform type operations during compilation. It allows developers to write more generalized code based on the characteristics of types.

Traits are typically implemented through template specialization and partial template specialization. Here is a simple example demonstrating how to use traits technology to determine if a type is an integer type:


```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>

template<typename T>
struct is_integer_trait {
    static const bool value = false;
};

template<>
struct is_integer_trait<int> {
    static const bool value = true;
};

template<>
struct is_integer_trait<long> {
    static const bool value = true;
};

// Specializations can continue for other integer types

int main() {
    std::cout << "Is int an integer type? " << is_integer_trait<int>::value << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Is double an integer type? " << is_integer_trait<double>::value << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In the above example, we define a basic `is_integer_trait` template that defaults to assuming all types are not integer types. Then, we provide special definitions for the `int` and `long` types through template specialization, marking them as integer types. In the `main` function, we use this trait to determine if `int` and `double` are integer types.

However, in practical development, we usually don't need to define such traits ourselves, as the C++ standard library already provides a rich set of type traits, including `std::is_integral`, `std::is_floating_point`, `std::is_pointer`, and more. These type traits can be directly used to determine the characteristics of types. Here is an example using standard library type traits:


```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Is int an integral type? " << std::is_integral<int>::value << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Is double a floating point type? " << std::is_floating_point<double>::value << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use `std::is_integral` and `std::is_floating_point` to determine the characteristics of the `int` and `double` types.

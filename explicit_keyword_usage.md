**Question**:

Explain the usage of the `explicit` keyword in C++ with code examples.

**Answer**:

In C++, the `explicit` keyword is used to prevent unwanted implicit type conversions. When you use the `explicit` keyword before a class constructor, that constructor will no longer be used for implicit type conversions and can only be used for explicit type conversions or as a constructor call.

The `explicit` keyword is often used for single-argument constructors to avoid unexpected behavior due to implicit type conversions. Here's an example of using the `explicit` keyword:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    explicit MyClass(int value) : data(value) {} // Using the explicit keyword

private:
    int data;
};

void foo(MyClass obj) {
    // ... Function implementation ...
}

int main() {
    // Explicitly creating a MyClass object
    MyClass obj(42);

    // Calling the foo function, using the explicitly created MyClass object
    foo(obj);

    // The following code will cause a compilation error because the constructor of MyClass is explicit
    // foo(42); // Error: Cannot implicitly convert from int to MyClass

    // However, you can use an explicit type conversion
    foo(MyClass(42)); // Correct: Explicitly creating a MyClass object

    return 0;
}
```

In the example above, trying to directly pass an integer `42` to the `foo` function, which takes a `MyClass` type parameter, will result in a compilation error because the constructor of `MyClass` is marked as `explicit`, thus it cannot implicitly convert from `int` to `MyClass`. However, you can explicitly call the constructor to create a `MyClass` object and pass it to the `foo` function.

Using the `explicit` keyword can improve the readability and safety of code, as it prevents potential errors caused by implicit type conversions. It's a good practice to use the `explicit` keyword when writing libraries or frameworks, especially when defining classes that might be widely used.

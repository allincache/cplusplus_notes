**Memory Order Constraints**

</br>

In C++11, memory order constraints are specified through the `std::memory_order` enumeration defined in the `<atomic>` header file. These constraints are used to control the synchronization and sequencing of atomic operations, ensuring the correctness of multithreaded programs.

Based on the requirements of the program, appropriate memory order constraints are selected. Common memory order constraints include:
- `memory_order_relaxed`: Does not enforce any synchronization or sequencing constraints.
- `memory_order_acquire`: Reads/writes after this operation cannot be reordered before it.
- `memory_order_release`: Reads/writes before this operation cannot be reordered after it.
- `memory_order_acq_rel`: Combines the constraints of both `acquire` and `release`.
- `memory_order_seq_cst`: Executes all operations in the same order for all threads.

Here's an example that illustrates how to use memory order constraints in C++11, accompanied by code:

```cpp
#include <atomic>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

std::atomic<int> counter(0);
std::atomic<bool> flag(false);

void increment_counter() {
    // Atomically increment using memory_order_relaxed
    // This means this operation may be reordered with operations in other threads
    counter.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);

    // Set the flag using memory_order_release
    // This means all writes before set_flag cannot be reordered after this operation
    flag.store(true, std::memory_order_release);
}

void wait_for_flag_and_print() {
    // Wait for the flag to be set using memory_order_acquire
    // This means all reads after the flag is set cannot be reordered before this operation
    while (!flag.load(std::memory_order_acquire)) {
        // Wait
    }

    // Now it's safe to read the value of counter
    // Because we know the setting of flag (with release semantics) happens before we read counter
    std::cout << "Counter: " << counter.load(std::memory_order_relaxed) << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(increment_counter);
    std::thread t2(wait_for_flag_and_print);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we have two threads: `t1` and `t2`. The `t1` thread increments the value of `counter` and sets `flag` to `true`. The `t2` thread waits for `flag` to be set to `true`, then reads and prints the value of `counter`.

We use different memory order constraints:
- In the `increment_counter` function, `counter.fetch_add` uses `memory_order_relaxed` because the operation of incrementing the counter itself does not need to maintain strict order with other operations.
- `flag.store` uses `memory_order_release`, indicating that all writes before `flag` is set (such as writes to `counter`) cannot be reordered after this setting operation.
- In the `wait_for_flag_and_print` function, `flag.load` uses `memory_order_acquire`, indicating that all reads after `flag` is read (such as reads of `counter`) cannot be reordered before this read operation.

By using these methods, we can ensure that when the `t2` thread reads the value of `counter`, it sees all the write operations performed by the `t1` thread on `counter`.
